    <h1>Welcome to the css <em>nightmare</em>.</h1>
    <h2>This is page 1.</h2>
    <div class= "firstdiv">
        <p>I think the best place to start is with basic positioning. <br>
        There appear to be 3 basic categories: <br></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Absolute positioning</li>
            <li>Relative positioning</li>
            <li>Fixed positioning</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <h2>Absolute positioning</h2><br>
            An element with absolute positioning is removed from the document, and any other
            elements that are capable will flow into its released space. You can then position the
            object anywhere you like within the document using the top, right, bottom, and left
            properties. It will then rest on top of (or behind) other elements.</p>
            <p> <h2>Relative positioning</h2><br>
                Likewise, you can move the object relative to the location it would occupy in the normal
                document flow.</p>
        <p> <h2>Fixed positioning</h2><br>
            The final positioning property setting lets you move an object to an absolute location,
            but only within the current browser viewport. Then, when the document is scrolled,
            the object remains exactly where it has been placed, with the main document scrolling
            beneath itâ€”a great way to create dock bars and other similar devices. </p>
